# IFC-Suite
Your shiny new IFC toolbox

## About
This is the python core of the [IFC Suite application](https://ifcsuite.inex/fr), ran by [INEX BET](https://www.inex/fr).
IFC Suite is a free set of tools that helps you manage IFC files.
We advocate for the IFC format as it ensures standardized, efficient data sharing across diverse BIM and CAD software.
IFC editing features are powered by the [IfcOpenShell](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell) python library. Big thanks to everyone who contributes to this project!

## Quickstart
At the moment, the IFC Merge is the only one available
If you run the main.py script, it will merge the files contained in the <models_to_open> array.
The output merged file will appear in the output folder.
